## ✨ Theme / Inspiration

This section is part of a personal portfolio project inspired by clean, dark-themed UI design. The goal was to craft a contact form that looks modern, professional, and visually engaging—without relying on media queries or any external CSS libraries. The purple-pink accent adds energy to the minimalist layout.

## 🎨 Design Decisions

- Used **pure CSS with Flexbox** to make the layout naturally responsive.
- Set a **dark background** (`#080808`) with contrasting elements to emphasize content readability.
- Applied **custom borders and shadows** for inputs and containers to enhance depth and interactivity.
- Components like `.contact-info` and `.contact-form` are made flexible using `flex: 1 1 350px` with `max-width`, allowing them to stack automatically on smaller screens.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Ensuring responsiveness **without media queries** was a major challenge—handled via `flex-wrap` and flexible units.
- Some form fields initially **broke out of their containers** due to inconsistent padding, borders, and box-sizing.
- Maintaining **consistent styling** across different browsers while preserving clean visual hierarchy took detailed testing and refinement.
