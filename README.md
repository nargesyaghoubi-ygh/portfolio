## 🎨 Theme / Inspiration  
This portfolio website is inspired by the idea of a clean, modern, and professional personal brand presentation. The design focuses on simplicity and clarity to showcase skills, projects, and contact information efficiently. The dark-themed background with vibrant accent colors was chosen to give a modern and elegant feel while enhancing readability. 🌑✨

## 🛠️ Design Decisions  
- **Responsive Layout:** The site is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes from desktops to mobile devices 📱💻  
- **Navigation:** A fixed top navigation bar with a hamburger menu on smaller screens improves usability and accessibility 🍔  
- **Typography and Colors:** Clear and readable fonts combined with a dark background and contrasting colors were selected for visual comfort and style 🎨🖋️  
- **Section Organization:** Content is divided into clear, meaningful sections (About, Education, Skills, Projects, Courses, Contact) for intuitive navigation 📚🗂️  
- **Form Design:** The contact form is designed with usability in mind, ensuring fields are easily accessible and visually distinct ✉️📝

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced  
- **Responsive Hamburger Menu Without JavaScript:** Creating a fully functional hamburger menu using only HTML and CSS was challenging but achieved using checkbox hack techniques ✅  
- **Balancing Design and Usability:** Ensuring that the design looks appealing on all devices while keeping the content easy to navigate required careful CSS structuring and testing 🧪🔍  
- **Cross-Browser Consistency:** Maintaining consistent appearance and behavior across different browsers involved fine-tuning styles and layouts 🖥️🌐
